# This is my vim setup. There are many like it, but this is mine.

I have a pretty stripped down vim setup. I try to keep it that way. 

Four of my bundles are syntax highlighting for the random hacking I do, and one of them is vim-rails, for the random hacking I do.

I use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to load my bundles since it creates a simple git clone setup.

I like simple themes, so vividchalk it is. I've always used a "," as the leader key. 

This gives me access to a quick ",k" and I have a new tab. ",l" or ",h" are mapped to navigate the tabs (I use splits and tabs often).

This is a pretty barebones setup, but I think it's useful enough to not get in the way.
